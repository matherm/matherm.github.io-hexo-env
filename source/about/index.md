- Visualization and Topological Data Analysis

Having had an interest in computer science (the kind of thing behind computers and app*s) for over 5 years I finally moved from a software engineering/business IT role in 2013 to a role where I actually get to design and implement data and algorithm centric applications. As far as I recall, my interest in computability theory and machine learning began when I prepared for a course called Root Cause Analyis and Software Profiling in BI-applications as part of SAP consultancy program back in 2012. That’s when I first heard of Hubert Dreyfus’ book What Computers Still Can’t Do and Douglas Hofstadter’s Gödel, Escher, Bach. 

My first step into the direction of data centric applications was in Information Retrieval and enterprise search systems. I always loved data modelling and combining modelling with specialices data structures and queries was really a nice thing to do. My current work involves modelling regular (e.g. images) and non-regular (e.g. point sets) data structures and building pattern recognition systems around them. As beeing in applied sciences I'm always in a conflict between theoretically correct and practically applicable. The great thing about that is the infinite range of problems that fall exactly into this gap. 

For those interested, this blog was built using Hexo, which is both easy to use and enough flexible.
